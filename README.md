# MedGraph AI

**Hospital Intelligence Platform** — AI-powered clinical decision analysis with graph-based patient modeling and real-time hospital simulation.

**Production URL:** [`https://medgraph.vulniq.org`](https://medgraph.vulniq.org)

---

## What It Does

MedGraph AI is a dual-layer hospital intelligence platform that operates at both **micro** (individual patient) and **macro** (hospital system) levels:

### Micro — Patient Graph Modeling

Every patient's hospital journey is modeled as a **directed graph** where each node is a clinical decision point. The system captures, analyzes, and visualizes the complete chain of medical decisions — from admission through discharge — enabling doctors, auditors, and administrators to understand exactly what happened, why, and what could have been done differently.

- **~24 decision nodes per patient**, each preserving **200+ data points** across 11 domains (vitals, labs, diagnosis, medications, risk scores, logistics, cost, etc.)
- **AI-powered risk assessment** — for each decision, the system finds similar historical cases, analyzes outcomes, and generates real-time clinical alerts (drug interactions, deadly patterns, hidden conditions)
- **Cross-case analysis** — graph alignment, similarity scoring, divergence detection, and outcome correlations across the entire patient population
- **Three outcome types:** HEALED, HEALED_WITH_COMPLICATIONS, DECEASED

### Macro — Hospital Simulation Engine

A full hospital operations simulator with **isometric 3D visualization**:

- **Single hospital mode** — configure departments, capacities, and patient load; simulate a full day with real-time queue management, occupancy tracking, and bottleneck detection
- **City mode** — simulate multiple hospitals simultaneously with inter-hospital patient transfers, ambulance routing, transfer mortality calculations, and load balancing
- **Configurable scenario planning** — adjust patient volume, department capacities, processing times, and time ranges; precompute entire simulations for instant timeline scrubbing
- **Isometric views** — floor-by-floor hospital visualization and city-wide bird's-eye view with animated patient transfers between hospitals
- **Detailed analytics** — department utilization heatmaps, queue lengths, wait times, patient flow statistics, and transfer logs

## Complete Data Model — What Each Node Captures

Each patient journey consists of ~24 decision nodes. Every node preserves a full clinical snapshot at that moment in time — approximately **200+ data points** across 11 domains:

### 1. Patient State

Every node records the patient's full clinical picture at that decision point:

- **Demographics** — age, gender, weight (kg), height (cm), BMI, ethnicity, insurance type
- **Medical history** — chronic conditions (each with condition name, ICD-10 code, diagnosed date, severity, controlled status, current medications, HbA1c if diabetic), allergies (allergen, reaction type, severity), risk factors, undiagnosed conditions discovered during the visit
- **Diagnosis** — primary diagnosis (name, ICD-10, confidence %, diagnosed at which node, severity, acuity, status), secondary diagnoses (name, ICD-10), differential diagnoses (each candidate with probability % and ruled-out flag)
- **Symptoms** — each symptom with severity (0–10), onset, duration, characteristics, anatomical location, change from last node, exacerbating factors, relieving factors
- **Vitals** — blood pressure (systolic + diastolic mmHg), heart rate (bpm + rhythm), respiratory rate, oxygen saturation (SpO2 % + supplemental O2 flag + flow rate), temperature (°C), consciousness level + Glasgow Coma Scale (3–15), pain score (0–10)
- **Lab results** — hematology (hemoglobin, WBC, platelets), chemistry (creatinine, glucose, potassium, sodium, BUN, lipase, amylase), coagulation (PT, INR, aPTT, D-dimer), cardiac markers (troponin, BNP), inflammatory markers (CRP, procalcitonin), blood gas (pH, bicarbonate, lactate) — each value with unit, status (normal/high/low/critical), critical flag, interpretation

### 2. Decision

The medical decision made at this node:

- **Action taken** — free-text description (e.g. "Start IV Heparin 80 units/kg bolus")

### AI Pipeline (Dual-Model)

All AI-powered API routes use a two-phase architecture:

1. **Phase 1 — MedGemma** (`google/medgemma-27b-text-it`): Performs structured clinical analysis — diagnosis reasoning, drug interactions, risk assessment, pathway auditing, cross-case pattern analysis. Non-streaming, returns full clinical text.
2. **Phase 2 — OpenAI** (`gpt-4o-mini`): Takes MedGemma's raw clinical output and presents it as polished, user-friendly markdown. Streaming response to client.
3. **Fallback**: If MedGemma endpoint is unavailable, routes fall back to OpenAI-only mode.

### AI Features

| API Route | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `/api/explain` | AI-powered node/decision explanation — analyzes a specific clinical decision and its context |
| `/api/chat` | Conversational AI for patient cases — ask questions about a patient's history, risks, and recommendations |
